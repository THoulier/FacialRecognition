# FacialRecognition
A statistical approach for facial recognition. The goal of the project is to implement a k-NN classifier to predict if a face (in entry) belongs to a base of faces. In order to improve the algorithm performances, we add a gaussian model to the datas.

All the statistical approach is based on PCA (Principal Component Analysis).

## Code
The main code is ``eigenfaces.m``. Others are functions used in the main code.

## Report
A report has been done in french for my school ENSEIRB-MATMECA, named ``TS115_HOULIER_BREJON.pdf``.
